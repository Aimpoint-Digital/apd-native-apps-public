# Welcome to CloudPAHL by Aimpoint Digital! 

## INTRODUCTION
**The purpose of this application is to allow administrators & super users to explore, understand, and optimize their Snowflake account usage.** \
**CloudPAHL** is comprised of four pages: 
1. **Platform Overview:** Summarizes both utilized and underutilized Snowflake Services 
2. **Audit Review:** Examines user behavior, identifies groups in need to additional training, and assesses for necessary action reviews or permission adjustments 
3. **Health Check Analysis:** Assesses cost and credit trends, attributing them to determine if Snowflake is scaling as anticipated or if unexpected costs are emerging and where 
4. **Lineage Visualization:** Displays role and object permissions 

## HOW TO
### 0) Requirements
The application requires access to the **SNOWFLAKE** database. Please use the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role for setup to grant the application access to this database. 
*We recommend running the CloudPAHL app on an XS warehouse, with the ability to auto-scale to 3 clusters maximum.*

### 1) Grant Permissions within CloudPAHL App
1. Please navigate Apps > CloudPAHL > to the **'CloudPAHL App Interface'** tab.
2. Grant application permissions as prompted by app. \
*The warehouse granted here will be utilized only by the task created in step 2 for refreshing app data*

### 2) Run SETUP_CLOUDPAHL() to initialize account usage data for app and set the refresh cadence
1. Navigate to a Snowflake worksheet.
2. ``` CALL CLOUDPAHL.CACHE_TABLES.SETUP_CLOUDPAHL(<refresh-cadence>); ```

\<refresh-cadence\> *OPTIONAL* \
The cadence data is refreshed via task. Accepted values are 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', or a custom CRON schedule (with timezone). 
- 'daily' creates task to run daily at 4am UTC
- 'weekly' creates task to run weekly on, every Sunday at 4am UTC
- 'monthly' creates task to run monthly, on the 1st of every month at 4am UTC

*The setup script completion time varies depending on the size of the account and the warehouse running the job. When you see this, or a similar result from `SETUP_CLOUDPAHL()`, you can continue on to the next steps:* \
```Setup complete: Data loaded. Task has been created using a cadence of daily```

### 3) Navigate back to CloudPAHL App and Begin Exploring!

CALL CLOUDPAHL.CACHE_TABLES.SETUP_CLOUDPAHL('daily', 'compute_wh');
-- Loads account usage data once, creates a tast to update daily

CALL CLOUDPAHL.CACHE_TABLES.SETUP_CLOUDPAHL('0 0,12 * * * Etc/UTC');
-- Loads account usage data, creates task to run twice a day at midnight and noon UTC
