# CloudPAHL, A Snowflake Healthcheck App by Aimpoint Digital
Snowflake has emerged as a preferred data warehouse as businesses migrate to the cloud, creating a 
demand for comprehensive insights into Snowflake usage. CloudPAHL addresses this need by 
focusing on fundamental cloud management aspects, starting with cost analysis. It goes beyond 
identifying high-expense warehouses and lengthy queries, utilizing a proprietary allocation model to 
accurately attribute 100% of Snowflake compute costs to users and applications.
